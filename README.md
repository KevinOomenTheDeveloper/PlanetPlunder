Planet plunder is a first person shooter game made in Unity and based on the first person shooter microgame from Unity learn.

This project was mainly used to understand the basics of Unity and general game development environments.

In this game you are a space pirate that wants to get to the mystical treasure planet.

Your charcter will try to achieve this goal by hopping from planet to planet to collect fuel and weapons native to that planet.

The idea was to create multiple planets with differnt ennemies native to these planets.

So far we have only implemented 1 planet which is the medieval planet where you can also find 2 new weapons: The sword(a high damage low range melee weapon) and the cannon(a slow recharge high damage ranged weapon with spalsh damage).
